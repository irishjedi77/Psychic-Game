# Psychic Game

This project uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The app randomly picks a letter between A-Z and the user must guess which letter the app selected using their keypad. The user begins with 10 guesses and the app tallies the number of user guesses, letters guessed so far, wins and losses. 

When the player wins, the app increases the win counter and starts the game over again (without refreshing the page).

When the player loses, the app increases the losses counter and restarts the game without a page refresh.
